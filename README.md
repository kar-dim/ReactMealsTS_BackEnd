# ReactMealsTS_BackEnd
This is the backend (.NET/Java Backend) of my own implementation [Link](https://github.com/kar-dim/ReactMealsTS_FrontEnd) of Maximilian's [React Meals](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) (as of 2023).

This new backend implementation makes use of these features among others:
- NGROK for dev https hosting.
- EF Core (SQL Server db) for database operations.
- Auth0 Authentication/Authorization flaw (register/login, auth0 actions/claims/policies etc).

Branch springboot: Backend uses Java Spring Framework and its technologies instead of .NET Core Framework.
